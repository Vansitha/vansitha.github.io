# Personal Portfolio Site

No fancy framework used. Randomly had a thought of building a portfolio website for myself. So I got to work and started to design and build it. Built it mainly to learn html, css and javascript. Although I had learnt it before and forgotten everything. XD
Will be upgrading to a framework later down the road. For now its just good old html, css and javascript.

Feedback and suggestions on improvements much appreciated!
