# Personal Portfolio Site

No fancy framework used. Randomly had a thought of building a portfolio website for myself. So then I got into work designing and building it from scratch. Mainly built to learn html, css and javascript. Although I had learnt it before and forgotten everything. XD
Will be upgrading to a framework later down the road. For now its just good old html, css and javascript.

Feedback and suggestions on improvements much appreciated!
